# README

This is a project built with Ruby on Rails on the front and backend.  It is a simple CRUD application that allows you to add products to a shopping cart and empty the cart. Future iterations will add user authentication and a payment option.

To use:  First clone and cd into the directory. Run "rails db:migrate && rails db:seed".  To start the server and begin using the application run "rails s."
